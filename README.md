# CODE QUIZ

In this coding challenge, I used vanilla Javascript web APIs to create a quiz, where the majority of the interaction and HTML elements are being dynamically loaded using JavaScript.

## The Challenges

This project was quite difficult, as using JavaScript to create HTML elements, show and hide them, and interface with the local storage became a game of whack-a-mole. Fix one thing, and a new problem popped up.

Adding a timer component, along with storing user scores, made this quiz even more of a task in research, experimentation, and refinement.

But my goal was to keep the code as clean and consise as possible, re-using HTML elements and CSS code, and ensuring my functions are manageable and use dynamic loops to generate content wherever possible.
